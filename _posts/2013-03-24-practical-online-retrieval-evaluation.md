Thank you to all those who attended the <a title="ECIR 2012" href="http://ecir2013.org/">ECIR 2013</a> tutorial on Practical Online Retrieval Evaluation that Filip Radlinski and I gave today. We updated some of the slides from the version that was provided on the conference USB stick. Below are the updated slides and links to additional resources.

<ul>
<li><a href="http://sdrv.ms/X19kUZ">PPT</a> slides (based on the 2011 SIGIR tutorial by Yisong Yue and Filip Radlinski, the slides of this earlier tutorial are available on <a title="Yisong's website" href="http://www.yisongyue.com/research.php#tutorials">Yisong's website</a>) [<a href="http://ilps.science.uva.nl/sites/ilps.science.uva.nl/files/2013%20ECIR%20Tutorial%20on%20Practical%20Online%20Evaluation.pdf">PDF</a> version without animations]</li>
