title: About
---

I am a Researcher at the Machine Intelligence and Perception group at
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/">Microsoft Research Cambridge</a>.
I develop interactive learning algorithms. Much of my research happens in the context of
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project-malmo/">Project Malmo</a> - an AI experimentation
platform that my team and I developed on top of the popular computer game Minecraft.

Before joining Microsoft Research, I did my PhD in the ILPS group at the
<a href="http://www.uva.nl/en/home">University of Amsterdam</a> My research focused on developing efficient and robust
interactive learning algorithms for search engines. My advisors were Maarten de Rijke and Shimon Whiteson.
