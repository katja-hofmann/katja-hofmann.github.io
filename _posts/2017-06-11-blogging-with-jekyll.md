# Blogging with Jekyll

I recently realized that my WordPress website / blog had gone stale. The last entry dated more than two years ago. Adding content to that site had always had a high overhead. Looking for alternatives, it turns out the web has moved on to more light-weight solutions. [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) in particular looks like it could be fun.

I'd like to be able to write equations in latex - [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) provides this functionality, and it's easy to integrate with Jekyll (see [Jekyll Extras](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/extras/)). Let's see if this works: $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$ (this and more examples: [Mathjax with Jekyll](http://gastonsanchez.com/visually-enforced/opinion/2014/02/16/Mathjax-with-jekyll/)). Brilliant - works like a charm!

Next up: importing content from my old WordPress site, and generating a list of publications.
