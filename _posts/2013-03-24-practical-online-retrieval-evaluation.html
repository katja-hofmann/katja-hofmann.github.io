<p>Thank you to all those who attended the <a title="ECIR 2012" href="http://ecir2013.org/">ECIR 2013</a> tutorial on Practical Online Retrieval Evaluation that Filip Radlinski and I gave today. We updated some of the slides from the version that was provided on the conference USB stick. Below are the updated slides and links to additional resources.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://sdrv.ms/X19kUZ">PPT</a> slides (based on the 2011 SIGIR tutorial by Yisong Yue and Filip Radlinski, the slides of this earlier tutorial are available on <a title="Yisong's website" href="http://www.yisongyue.com/research.php#tutorials">Yisong's website</a>) [<a href="http://ilps.science.uva.nl/sites/ilps.science.uva.nl/files/2013%20ECIR%20Tutorial%20on%20Practical%20Online%20Evaluation.pdf">PDF</a> version without animations]</li>
<li>Demo scripts: these are based on Yisong's material, available from <a title="Yisong's website" href="http://www.yisongyue.com/research.php#tutorials">his website</a></li>
<li>Additional reference implementations of Balanced Interleave, Team Draft, and Probabilistic Interleaving in python are part of our <a href="http://ilps.science.uva.nl/resources/online-learning-framework">Learning to Rank Framework</a>, released with our WSDM 2013 paper <a href="http://ilps.science.uva.nl/biblio/reusing-historical-interaction-data-faster-online-learning-rank-ir">Reusing Historical Interaction Data For Faster Online Learning To Rank For IR</a> by Katja Hofmann, Anne Schuth, Shimon Whiteson, and Maarten de Rijke</li>
