This summer, I was invited to teach at <a href="http://romip.ru/russir2014/">RuSSIR</a> - the Russian Summer School in Information Retrieval in Nizhny Novgorod. I very much enjoyed the enthusiasm and insightful questions of the students. Thanks again to all who attended my lectures, and to the organizers!

My 5 lectures broadly covered online evaluation and learning to rank for information retrieval. This includes topics such as AB-testing, interleaved comparisons, estimation of online metrics from exploration data, and bandits for online learning to rank. If you want to review some of the material, you can now access my slides here: <a title="http://1drv.ms/1yYLNlp" href="http://1drv.ms/1yYLNlp">http://1drv.ms/1yYLNlp</a>.
